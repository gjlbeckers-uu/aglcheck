What is aglcheck?
-----------------
aglcheck is a python library for analyzing strings used in artificial grammar
learning experiments.

aglcheck was written to analyze string sets for acoustic similarity
in a sample of 9 artificial grammar learning (AGL) studies in nonhuman
animals, in order to assess how likely it is that the subjects learn their task
without the use of grammatical rules.
