aglcheck-0.1.0:

2016.08.01: aglcheck 0.1.0 released. This version is intended to enable
referees of the paper for which this package was written to verify that the
code is openly available. However, documentation still has to be written.
Coming 0.1.x versions should be compatible with the jupyter notebook that
forms the supplementary information of the paper.
